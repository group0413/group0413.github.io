  <p><em>Crispr-Cas9 technology comes with a wide range of opportunities and applications within our Society. Some include accurately editing genomes, creating vaccines, agriculture and combating Against cancer. The applications for Crispr-Cas9 will only increase as more advancements and Refinements are made. 

    Our first key opportunity presented is the application of Crispr-Cas9 technology in itâ€™s Implementation of accurately editing genomes in human cells. According to spandidos Publications of 2019 the methods of Crispr-Cas9 are easy to apply within cell lines of laboratory Animals and vegetation which is currently being tested in human trialings. By using the Technology in changing the sequence of the gRNA we can target cells that cause disease and Mutations and permanently change them. This creates huge opportunities in the medical field as Millions are affected around the world from different immune system defects and diseases. 
    
    Over the past few years there has been research and development of Crispr-Cas9 technology in The field of vaccinology and the study of vaccines. The research of Crispr-Cas9 within the study Of vaccines has helped give scientists a better understanding of the structures and functions of Viral protein genes. There is a huge potential within this sector for the use case of Crispr-Cas9 Technology by manipulating viral genomes and creating a better understanding and resistances Of current viruses plaguing our society.  
    
    An important opportunity that Crispr-Cas9 provides is within the agriculture industry. Agriculture Is essential for our survival as everyone in our day to day lives needs food and sustenance. With Crispr-Cas9 technology we can genetically modify the genomes of specific crops to create Super strains with increased resistances against droughts, diseases and pests. This will help Increase yields and improve the quality of nutritional value. This could end the use of farmers Having to use pesticides to protect their crops and stop harmful poisons being released and Save farmers millions each year. 
    
    The biggest potential with Crispr-Cas9 technology is the potential it has in the combat against Cancer. Crispr-Cas9 has currently been utilised for large scale modeling of genetic screenings to Look for gene functions that have been linked to cancer. With more research and future findings Taking safety measures into consideration, Crispr-Cas9 can be used to help diagnose patients And help reduce cellular growth which can lead to the elimination of the cancer cells entirely. </em></p>
