<p><em>CRISPR-Cas9 technology enables the simultaneous editing of numerous genes. Multiplexing is a capability that allows for more intricate genetic alterations. Depending on the desired result and the complexity of the genetic modification, researchers can select to edit a single gene or use multiplexing.</br> </br>

  

  

  the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to investigate anti-CRISPR solutions. The red line of this technology is the manipulation of the human embryo, Anti-CRISPR proteins, which are powerful molecules that prevent the CRISPRâ€“Cas9 system, may have the potential to promote better utilization of the CRISPR-Cas system in gene editing, </br></br>
  
    
  
  scientists have developed HifiCas9 technology that is designed to minimize off-target effects happening in Crisper Cas9 technology, the goal of these modified version is to decrease the interactions between Cas9 and DNA backbone, reducing off-target activity, thus give much better result. </br></br>
  
    
  
  Common delivery methods include viral vectors, such as lentivirus or adenovirus, which can efficiently deliver the CRISPR components into cells. Non-viral methods, such as electroporation or lipid-based transfection, can also be used for certain applications. </br></br>
  
    
  
  CRISPER-Cas9 can be used not only for gene editing but also for gene regulation. Instead of introducing DNA breaks, researchers can utilize a modified version of Cas9 called HIFICas9, fused with transcriptional activators or repressors. This approach, know has CRISPERa (CRISPER activation) and CRISPERi (CRISPER interference), simultaneously allows for precise control of gene expression without alternation DNA sequence. </br></br></em></p>
