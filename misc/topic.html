<h1>Precision Medicine/Gene editing using CRISPER Cas9 Technology</br></h1>

<p><em>What is precision medicine? The use of precision medicine, otherwise known as personalized medicine, takes into account a patient’s genome to form a more personalized medicine.  Why is this an important aspect in medicine? A patient’s DNA can vary greatly as a result of factors including differing ethnicity, lifestyle-choices and environments. By examining DNA markers scientists discovered a correlation between the presence of certain markers and the rates of success. Precision medicine started growing when the double helix was discovered, and it has been growing exponentially since. A category of precision medicine that has been growing is gene therapy. This is when the bases of DNA are changed purposefully to produce the desired phenotype. Computer technology comes into play through processing the data of different DNA base sequences, this helps make the process faster and easier. CRISPER Cas-9 is the most popular technology used to do this job.  </br></br>

  CRISPER is a simple technology used by many scientists to change, replace and remove DNA sequences.  CRISPER wasn't created by humans but rather we took advantage of what nature created naturally. Scientists found that they can help patients with genetic related diseases by changing the genome early on and simply “turning off” the sequences that create the trait. Crisper is short snippets of repetitive DNA sequences. The altering part is done by the Cas protein which works with crisper. For example, let's say a virus invades the cell, the Cas protein will snip at the DNA sequences and keep a shorter DNA string of the virus called RNA. The RNA is then placed with the Cas protein so that in the future, if the same virus invades, the protein is able to detect it faster to fight back. How do scientists use this? To remove the gene, they simply design the RNA of the gene they want to remove to the Cas protein. The protein then only snips off DNA that matches the RNA. Now where does computer science fit into all of this? DNA is made up of 4 bases named C,T,G,A and the pattern defines the protein that will react with the bases. This is a lot of patterns for just humans to use, so many computer systems have been created to help design gRNA (guide RNA). There are much software's, like GuideMaker and CRISPRdirect, these software's are complex so to put it simply. The software scans the input genome (that they want to insert) from the user and they want to change. and the program scans through its database and gives the user a summer and the different gRNA it could use. Because crisper Cas9 is not 100% accurate, the program can predict score on the gene successfully accepting the gene into the sequence. Technology is still developing and software like GuideMaker, makes the process more accessible, faster and easier to improve. Creating the gRNA is the most important part of Crispr and alters how it will look like in the future.</br></br></p></em>
