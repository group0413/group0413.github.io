<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>There are some recent reports in the scientific literature that this approach is not as precise as advertised. In other words, we think we are editing one letter of the book of life, but  actually entire pages might be getting altered in unwanted areas.</br></br><p></h4>


<p><em>The possibility of artificially creating cancerous tumours will also increase, when they can treat cancer patients with CRISPR. Therefore, the cancer bomb can be implemented using CRISPR. As a result, today, CRISPR technology is proposed as a new biological weapon.</br> </br>

  

  genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using this technology which leads to the creation of unwanted species, which is unbalancing the environmental chain. </br></br>
  
    
  
    
  
  Editing out the kind of people that medical science, and the society it has formed, classify as ill or genetically contaminated—those like us who are seen to have lousy genes—can likewise negatively limit human variety and exacerbate social inequality. However, it's important to remember that both good and negative genes may contribute to successful outcomes in life. We as a society would effectively instrumentalize this moralistic and reductionist premise if CRISPR was used to eradicate genetic variation rather than cure it.</br></br> 
  
    
  
    
  
  As disability studies scholars and women with genetic differences who are experts in thinking about the consequences this technology will have for actual human beings, we have grave worries that the use of these “genetic scissors” will, in the future, cut people like us out of existence without others even noticing. Scientists who use CRISPR could see editing genes such as ours out of the gene pool as entirely uncontroversial. </br></br>
  
    
  
  using these "genetic scissors" will eventually eliminate people like us without anyone noticing. </br></br>
  
    
  
    
  
   
  The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a potent gene-editing tool that could revolutionise a number of industries, including biotechnology, medicine, and agriculture. But as with any new technology, it's crucial to think about any environmental risks and ramifications. </br></br>
  
  the use of Crisper/cas9 within environments like animals, plants, and soil also led to an increase in novel pathogenic organisms. </br></br>
  
    
  
  genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using this technology leads to the creation of unwanted species, There is a risk that modified genes could spread beyond their intended target organism. Gene flow between genetically modified organism and wild populations could lead to unintended alterations in ecosystem and the potential and wild genetic diversity. </br></br>
  
    
  
  If gene-edited crops with improved traits are released into the environment, there is a possibility that they could become invasive, spreading beyond intended cultivation areas. This could have ecological implications and potentially harm native plant species or disrupt local ecosystems. </br></br></em></p>
