			improving greatly although there has been ethical concerns. How far is 
			too far? There has been tests on cloning and modifying living animals to
			gain the traits we want, what happens once it moves on to humans? Compters
			speed up the process by doing the tedious steps and the growth of this technology
			could lead to the gene modifcation becoming easily accessiable.
			This is a scary concept which is why we wanted to discuss on it.
